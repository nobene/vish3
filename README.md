# Vish3
A simple shell written in V. This barely works.
It's a shameless fork of :
 https://github.com/CRKatri/vsh
 with some improvements.
## Running
`v run .`

## Building
`v .`

## Features :

 It has built-in commands : help, cd , pwd, exit

 It has working prompt following scheme : 
 `user@machine:$/home/user/ >> `

 It has no history, nor it is planned to have such feature.
